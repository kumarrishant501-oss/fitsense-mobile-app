## 🧠 Smart Recommendation Logic

The app analyzes your daily check-in to provide ONE smart action:

- **Red (Rest)** → Full rest day (recovery is progress!)

## 📊 Weekly Insights

Instead of charts and graphs, FitSense provides insights as simple sentences:
- "You feel better on days you sleep well"
- "Light movement helps when you're sore"
- "You've shown up 4 days this week - that's amazing"
